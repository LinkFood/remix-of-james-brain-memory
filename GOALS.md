# LinkJac — Goals

## Why This Exists

Because "hey remember this" should actually work.

## Core Beliefs

1. Dumping should take 2 seconds, not 2 minutes
2. AI organizes, humans think
3. Your brain is yours — own it, export it, delete it
4. The best interface is no interface
5. If the user has to decide where something goes, we failed
6. The value of a thought increases over time if something is watching

## What We're Building

A second brain that actually works. Not a note app. Not a database. Not Notion.

A place to dump anything — and an AI named Jac that finds the patterns you can't see yourself.

## The Three Layers

1. **DUMP** — Zero-friction capture. Jac classifies silently. *Built.*
2. **CONNECT** — Jac finds semantic relationships across your entries over time. *Built, proving.*
3. **ENRICH** — Jac brings external context to your internal thoughts. *Built, needs grounding.*

## The Canvas

The dashboard transforms when you ask Jac a question. Entries highlight, connections draw, clusters form. Jac doesn't answer in chat — Jac rearranges your brain visually.

## Who It's For

- People who tried Notion and bounced
- People who text themselves reminders
- People who have 47 browser tabs as "memory"
- People whose brains don't stop
- People who just want to remember shit

## The Feel

- **Fast**: Under 1 second to dump
- **Invisible**: AI works, user doesn't notice
- **Forgiving**: Works offline, handles errors
- **Alive**: Things move, update, respond
- **Surprising**: Jac shows you patterns you didn't know you had

## The Anti-Goals

- NOT complicated
- NOT full of options
- NOT asking questions
- NOT making users organize
- NOT another Notion clone

## The North Star

A user dumps something, forgets about it, and three weeks later Jac says "this connects to that — here's what it means." That moment is the product.

## Tagline

**"Stop organizing. Start dumping."**
