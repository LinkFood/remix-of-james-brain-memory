# LinkJac — Goals

## Why This Exists

Because "hey remember this" should actually work.

## Core Beliefs

1. Dumping should take 2 seconds, not 2 minutes
2. AI organizes, humans think
3. Your brain is yours — own it, export it, delete it
4. The best interface is no interface
5. If the user has to decide where something goes, we failed

## What We're Building

A second brain that actually works. Not a note app. Not a database. Not Notion.

A place to dump anything and find it later.

## Who It's For

- People who tried Notion and bounced
- People who text themselves reminders
- People who have 47 browser tabs as "memory"
- People whose brains don't stop
- People who just want to remember shit

## The Feel

- **Fast**: Under 1 second to dump
- **Invisible**: AI works, user doesn't notice
- **Forgiving**: Works offline, handles errors
- **Alive**: Things move, update, respond

## The Anti-Goals

- NOT complicated
- NOT full of options
- NOT asking questions
- NOT making users organize
- NOT another Notion clone

## The North Star

"Hey remember this" → It actually remembers.
